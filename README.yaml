# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Create a GitHub Personal Access Token that has `admin:repo_hook` for full control of repository hooks; in otherwords, we need `write:repo_hook` to write repository hooks and `read:repo_hook` to read repository hooks.

  ```hcl
  module "github_webhooks" {
    source               = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-github-repository-webhooks.git?ref=master"
    github_organization  = "cloudposse"
    github_token         = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    github_repositories  = "geodesic"
    webhook_url          = "https://atlantis.prod.company.com"
    webhook_content_type = "application/json"
    events               = ["issues"]
  }
  ```

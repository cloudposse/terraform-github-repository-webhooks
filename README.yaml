# How to use this project
usage: |-

  Create a GitHub Personal Access Token that has `admin:repo_hook` for full control of repository hooks; in otherwords, we need `write:repo_hook` to write repository hooks and `read:repo_hook` to read repository hooks.

  ```hcl
  module "github_webhooks" {
    source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-github-repository-webhooks.git?ref=master"
    github_organization = "cloudposse"
    github_token        = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    github_repositories = "geodesic"
    webhook_url         = "https://atlantis.prod.company.com/"
    content_type        = "application/json"
    events              = ["issues"]
  }
  ```

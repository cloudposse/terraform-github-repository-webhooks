usage: |-
  Create a GitHub Personal Access Token that has `admin:repo_hook` for full control of repository hooks; in otherwords, we need `write:repo_hook` to write repository hooks and `read:repo_hook` to read repository hooks.

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  ```hcl
  module "github_webhooks" {
    source = "cloudposse/repository-webhooks/github"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    github_organization  = "cloudposse"
    github_token         = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    github_repositories  = ["geodesic"]
    webhook_url          = "https://atlantis.prod.company.com"
    webhook_content_type = "json"
    events               = ["issues"]
  }
